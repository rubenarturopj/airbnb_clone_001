#### Authentication UI

1. Create the Modal component. In layout.tsx, add the Modal component above Navbar, always between out ClientOnly tags. Create a folder in app/components/ called "modals". Then create the "Modal.tsx" file in app/components/modals/, fill the modal.tsx with basic structure so i doesn't give errors. Keep working on the modal and add the (imported) components, functions and styles needed.

2. Create Register modal. In the folder /app/ create a new folder called hooks /app/hooks/, in it create a file named: useRegisterModal.ts (((the extension is TS not TSX))).

-   Install the following package: _npm install zustand_. Restart the app. Refresh the browser.

```sh
npm install zustand
```

-   Work on the useRegisterModal.ts file.

3. in the foler "modals" (app/components/modals) create a file named "RegisterModal.tsx" (((the extension now is TSX and not TS))). Create its basic structure.

4. Go to layout.tsx and DELETE the modal component entirely. In it's place, type in the RegisterModal component that we just created and import it on top. Remove the other import we won't use anymore (from Modal).

5. Instal AXIOS (_npm install axios_). Install React-Hooks-Forms (_npm install react-hook-form_).

```sh
npm install axios
```

```sh
npm install react-hook-form
```

-   Restart your app and refresh the browser.
-   Go back to RegisterModal.tsx and import axios, react-hook-form, react-icons, stuff from react and the useRegisterModal. Implement the previously deleted MOdal there and set everything up so it works.

6. Add the functions to the hamburger menu options (log in, sign up). Go to app/components/Navbar/UserMenu.tsx. There import useRegisterModal, grab it as a const, and pass the function in the return.

7. Go back to RegisterModal.tsx to write the body of the modal in a const and pass it in the return.

8. Create the Heading component in app/components/Heading.tsx, fill it in. Import it in RegisterModal. Go give Headings some inputs in RegisterModal.tsx.

9. Create the Input component in a new folder called "inputs". /app/components/inputs/Input.tsx. Fill it in. Place it under Heading component in RegisterModal.tsx. Add 3 inputs in total: name, email and password. If you are succesfull, if you click submit on the form and they inputs are not filled, it should show an error by changing the ouline to red. Also in the console you should be able to see an error from Axios, because the server doesn't exist yet.

10. Install React-hot-toast (_npm install react-hot-toast_). And restart your app and refresh the browser. (for notifications).

```sh
npm install react-hot-toast
```

-   Got to /app/ and create a new folder called "providers". Inside, create a new file called "ToasterProvider.tsx". Fill it in with basic structure. Import Toaster in it and return the Toaster component imported. With this type of packages, we cannot simpli import it wherever we want to use it, but we need to create one instance in our app with a function so we can use that wherever we want.

-   Go to layout.tsx. Inside the ClientOnly tags and above RegisterModal tag, add the ToasterProvider tag.
-   Now that we have this Toaster Notifications, we are going to replace the way we show erros in the UI. Go to RegisterModal.tsx and in the onSubmit function, in the .catch section, delete the console log. and replace it with toast.error("message") and don-t forget to import it.

11. Let's create placeholders for register with github and google. In RegisterModals.tsx, create the "const footer". Pass the props and if you place Footer propo in MOdal. You shoul see the button with the google icon. For the github button, copy and paste the setup for the google one and change the data to fill it.
