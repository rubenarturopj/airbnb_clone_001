Next.js 13

Has an experimental /app/ folder phase. Instead of using /src/, it's using /app/.

Next.js work for both server and client side.

"use client"

If we're working with components that will help the client directly, then we need to write
 "use client" on top of that file. So we hydrate it to the client.

Components that need use client, when we use:
- Interactivity and EventListeners: onClick(), onChange(), etc.
- Use state and lifecycle effects: useState(), useReducer(), useEffect(), etc.
- Use Browser-only APIs.
- Use costum hooks that depend on state, effects, or browser-only APIs.
- *** Fetch data BUT only when necessary, specific reasons. It's always better to do it on the server side.

Components that need _______, when we:

- Fetch data. (((Always recommended doing it on the server side, unless specific reasons 
to do it on the client side. Fetching data from the server, and then move it to the client, 
leads to better performance and user experience)))
- Access backendd resources (directly).
- Keep sensitive information on the server (access tokens, API keys, etc).
- Keep large dependencies on the server / Reduce client-side JavaScript.
