## Filters modal (Assigning various filters, add advanced querying logic to getListings, add loading and error pages)

### Create the search modal

1. Go to `app/hooks` folder, copy and paste `useLoginModal.ts` and rename it to `useSearchModal.ts`. Then change all the variables inside as well.

2. Go to `app/components/navbar/search.tsx` and start editing/adding stuff. Add a constant and add an onClick function for the first div.

3. In `app/components/modals` folder, create a file called: `SearchModal.tsx`. Fill it in as shown. Although it's not over yet, we'll keep editing here later. Don't forget to type: "use client" on top.

4. Go to the main `layout.tsx` file. And add the component `<SearchModal>` we just created between `ToasterProvider` and `RentModal`.

### Set filters for the 3 options on top of the UI (anywhere, any week, add guests)

### Create Modal to edit these options
