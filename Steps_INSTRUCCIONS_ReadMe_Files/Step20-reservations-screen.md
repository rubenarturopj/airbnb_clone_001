Create a route to cancel a reservation

1. Go to `app/api/reservations/` and create a new folder called `[reservationId]`. Inside, create a new file called `route.ts`. Import what you need. and fill it in. You can try it now and cancel a reservation on the UI. It should work. The code where we are deleting is in `TripsClient.tsx`.
