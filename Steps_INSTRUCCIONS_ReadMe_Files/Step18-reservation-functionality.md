## Reservation functionality (routes, logic)

-   Let's create the route for making reservations with axio.

1. Go to `app/api` and create a new folder called: `reservations`. Inside this folder create a file called: `route.ts`. ATTENTION: it's ROUTE not ROUTERRR. Fill it in, now make a reservation on the UI and it will be sent to the database.

2. After our past success. We are going to make the website to not allow us to make another reservation on the same dates because that date has already been taken. Go to `app/actions` and create a file called: `getReservation.ts`.

-   In `ListingClient.tsx`
